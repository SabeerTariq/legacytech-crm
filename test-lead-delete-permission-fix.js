console.log('‚úÖ Lead Delete Permission Fix Applied:');
console.log('   - Added permission check to LeadEditModal');
console.log('   - Delete button now only shows for users with delete permissions');
console.log('   - Front_sales users cannot delete leads from modal');
console.log('');

console.log('üìã Changes made:');
console.log('   1. Added usePermissions hook to LeadEditModal.tsx');
console.log('   2. Added canDelete("leads") check around delete button');
console.log('   3. Delete button now conditionally rendered based on permissions');
console.log('');

console.log('üîß Issue resolved:');
console.log('   - "I still deleted the lead by going on the view details on the lead and click on the delete button"');
console.log('   - Root cause: LeadEditModal had no permission checks');
console.log('   - Delete button was always visible regardless of user permissions');
console.log('   - Fixed by adding canDelete("leads") permission check');
console.log('');

console.log('‚úÖ Expected behavior after fix:');
console.log('   1. Front_sales users: No delete button in lead details modal');
console.log('   2. Admin users: Delete button visible in lead details modal');
console.log('   3. Permission check works in both main list and modal');
console.log('   4. Complete permission enforcement across all lead interfaces');

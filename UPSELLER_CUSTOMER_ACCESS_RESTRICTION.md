# 🔒 Upseller Customer Access Restriction Implementation

## Overview

This implementation ensures that **upsellers can only see customers that are assigned to them through projects**, maintaining proper data privacy and access control in the CRM system.

## 🎯 **What Was Implemented**

### **1. Customer List Restriction (Customers Page)**
- **Upsellers** only see customers from projects assigned to them
- **Front Sales users** only see customers they converted from leads
- **Managers/Admins** see all customers (no restriction)

### **2. Customer Selection Restriction (CustomerSelector Component)**
- **Upsellers** can only select from customers assigned to their projects
- **Front Sales users** can only select from customers they created
- Used in upsell forms and other customer selection scenarios

### **3. Customer Profile Access Control**
- **Upsellers** can only access customer profiles for customers assigned to them
- **Front Sales users** can only access customer profiles they created
- **Unauthorized access** redirects to customers list with error message

## 🔧 **Technical Implementation**

### **Database Query Logic**

#### **For Upsellers:**
```typescript
// Get projects assigned to this upseller
const { data: assignedProjects, error: projectsError } = await supabase
  .from('projects')
  .select('sales_disposition_id')
  .eq('assigned_pm_id', user.employee.id)
  .not('sales_disposition_id', 'is', null);

if (assignedProjects && assignedProjects.length > 0) {
  const salesDispositionIds = assignedProjects
    .map(p => p.sales_disposition_id)
    .filter(id => id !== null);
  
  // Filter customers by assigned project sales dispositions
  query = query.in('id', salesDispositionIds);
} else {
  // No assigned projects, return empty array
  return [];
}
```

#### **For Front Sales Users:**
```typescript
// Filter by user who created the customer
if (user?.employee?.department === 'Front Sales') {
  query = query.eq('user_id', user.id);
}
```

### **Permission Check Flow**

1. **User Authentication Check** - Ensure user is logged in
2. **Department Check** - Determine user's department (Front Sales, Upseller, etc.)
3. **Access Validation** - Verify user has permission to access specific customer
4. **Data Filtering** - Apply appropriate database filters
5. **Access Denied Handling** - Redirect unauthorized users with error messages

## 📁 **Files Modified**

### **1. `src/pages/Customers.tsx`**
- **Added upseller restriction** in `fetchCustomers()` function
- **Updated header messaging** for upseller users
- **Updated empty state messages** for upseller users

### **2. `src/components/sales/CustomerSelector.tsx`**
- **Added useAuth hook** for user context
- **Implemented upseller restriction** in `loadCustomers()` function
- **Consistent filtering** with main customers page

### **3. `src/pages/CustomerProfile.tsx`**
- **Restored authentication** (was previously removed)
- **Added permission checks** for both upseller and front sales users
- **Added access denied handling** with redirects and error messages

### **4. `src/hooks/useUpsell.ts`**
- **Already had correct implementation** for upseller restrictions
- **No changes needed** - was already filtering correctly

## 🔐 **Security Features**

### **Access Control Matrix**
| User Type | Customer Access | Project Access | Profile Access |
|-----------|----------------|----------------|----------------|
| **Front Sales** | Only their customers | N/A | Only their customers |
| **Upseller** | Only assigned customers | Only assigned projects | Only assigned customers |
| **Manager/Admin** | All customers | All projects | All customers |

### **Permission Validation**
- **Route-level protection** - Unauthorized access redirects to safe pages
- **Database-level filtering** - Queries only return permitted data
- **User context validation** - All operations verify user permissions
- **Error handling** - Graceful fallbacks for unauthorized access

## 🚀 **How It Works**

### **1. Customer List View**
```
Upseller Login → Check Department → Query Assigned Projects → 
Filter Customers by Project Sales Dispositions → Display Filtered Results
```

### **2. Customer Selection**
```
Upseller in Form → Check Department → Load Only Assigned Customers → 
User Selects from Permitted List → Proceed with Operation
```

### **3. Customer Profile Access**
```
Upseller Access Attempt → Validate Project Assignment → 
Allow/Deny Access → Redirect if Unauthorized
```

## 📊 **User Experience**

### **For Upsellers:**
- ✅ **See only relevant customers** - No data overload
- ✅ **Clear messaging** - "View customers assigned to your projects"
- ✅ **Consistent experience** - Same restrictions across all components
- ✅ **Helpful empty states** - "You'll see customers here once projects are assigned to you"

### **For Front Sales Users:**
- ✅ **See only their customers** - Maintains existing behavior
- ✅ **Clear messaging** - "View customers you converted from leads"

### **For Managers/Admins:**
- ✅ **See all customers** - Full system access for management
- ✅ **No restrictions** - Can manage and oversee all operations

## 🧪 **Testing Scenarios**

### **Test Case 1: Upseller Access**
1. Login as upseller user
2. Navigate to Customers page
3. **Expected**: Only see customers from assigned projects
4. **Expected**: Empty state if no projects assigned

### **Test Case 2: Customer Profile Access**
1. Login as upseller user
2. Try to access customer profile not assigned to them
3. **Expected**: Access denied, redirect to customers list

### **Test Case 3: Customer Selection**
1. Login as upseller user
2. Open upsell form
3. **Expected**: Only assigned customers appear in selector

### **Test Case 4: Front Sales Access**
1. Login as front sales user
2. Navigate to Customers page
3. **Expected**: Only see customers they converted

## 🔮 **Future Enhancements**

### **1. Database-Level RLS**
- Implement Row Level Security policies in Supabase
- Move filtering logic to database level for better performance

### **2. Caching Strategy**
- Cache assigned projects for upsellers
- Reduce database queries for better performance

### **3. Audit Logging**
- Track customer access attempts
- Log unauthorized access attempts for security monitoring

### **4. Real-time Updates**
- Notify upsellers when new projects are assigned
- Update customer lists automatically when assignments change

## 📝 **Implementation Notes**

### **Performance Considerations**
- **Efficient queries** - Single database call to get assigned projects
- **Proper indexing** - Uses existing indexes on `assigned_pm_id` and `sales_disposition_id`
- **Minimal data transfer** - Only fetches necessary customer data

### **Error Handling**
- **Graceful degradation** - Empty states instead of errors
- **User-friendly messages** - Clear explanations of restrictions
- **Proper logging** - Console logs for debugging and monitoring

### **Maintainability**
- **Consistent patterns** - Same filtering logic across components
- **Centralized logic** - Permission checks in reusable functions
- **Clear documentation** - Code comments explain the business logic

## ✅ **Summary**

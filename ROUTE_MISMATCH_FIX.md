# 🔧 Route Mismatch Fix - Issue Resolved!

## 🐛 Problem Identified

The "projects, all projects, projects assignment page not found" error was occurring because there were mismatches between the navigation menu paths and the actual routes defined in `App.tsx`. Users clicking on navigation menu items were being directed to routes that didn't exist.

### Root Cause
The navigation menu in `NavigationMenu.tsx` had different paths than the routes defined in `App.tsx`, causing 404 errors when users tried to access pages through the navigation.

## ✅ Solution Implemented

### **Fixed Project Routes**

#### **Project Assignment Route**
```typescript
// Navigation Menu: /projects/assignment
// Before: /project-assignment
// After: /projects/assignment
```

#### **My Projects Route**
```typescript
// Navigation Menu: /projects/my-projects
// Before: /my-projects
// After: /projects/my-projects
```

### **Fixed Department Routes**

#### **Development Department**
```typescript
// Navigation Menu: /departments/development
// Before: /development
// After: /departments/development
```

#### **Front Sales Department**
```typescript
// Navigation Menu: /departments/front-sales
// Before: /front-sales
// After: /departments/front-sales
```

#### **HR Department**
```typescript
// Navigation Menu: /departments/hr
// Before: /hr
// After: /departments/hr
```

#### **Marketing Department**
```typescript
// Navigation Menu: /departments/marketing
// Before: /marketing
// After: /departments/marketing
```

### **Fixed HR Routes**

#### **Employees Route**
```typescript
// Navigation Menu: /hr/employees
// Before: /employees
// After: /hr/employees
```

### **Fixed Automation Route**

#### **Automation Route**
```typescript
// Navigation Menu: /automation
// Before: /marketing-automation
// After: /automation
```

### **Added Missing Department Routes**

Added routes for department pages that were in the navigation menu but missing from `App.tsx`:

#### **Other Department**
```typescript
// Added route: /departments/other
<Route path="/departments/other" element={<Other />} />
```

#### **Production Department**
```typescript
// Added route: /departments/production
<Route path="/departments/production" element={<Production />} />
```

#### **Upseller Department**
```typescript
// Added route: /departments/upseller
<Route path="/departments/upseller" element={<Upseller />} />
```

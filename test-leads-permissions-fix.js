console.log('âœ… Leads permissions fix applied:');
console.log('   - Added permission checks to Leads page');
console.log('   - Added permission checks to LeadsHeader component');
console.log('   - Added permission checks to LeadsContent component');
console.log('   - Added permission checks to LeadsList component');
console.log('   - Updated front_sales role to read-only for leads');
console.log('   - Added delete functionality with permission checks');

console.log('ðŸ“‹ Changes made:');
console.log('   1. Added usePermissions import to Leads.tsx');
console.log('   2. Added canCreate and canDelete permission checks');
console.log('   3. Updated LeadsHeader to conditionally show Add Lead button');
console.log('   4. Updated LeadsContent to pass permission props');

console.log('ðŸ”§ Issue resolved:');
console.log('   - "IN the roles management module, I restricted the front_sales role to just read and view the leads module, but upon accessing the module with that role I am able to add and delete the leads also"');
console.log('   - Root cause: No permission checks in leads module UI components');
console.log('   - Front_sales role had empty permissions array');
console.log('   - Add/Delete buttons were always visible regardless of permissions');
console.log('');

console.log('âœ… Expected behavior after fix:');
console.log('   1. Front_sales users should only see "View Details" in dropdown');
console.log('   2. Front_sales users should not see "Add Lead" button');
console.log('   3. Front_sales users should not see "Delete Lead" option');
console.log('   4. Admin/Manager users should still see all actions');
console.log('   5. Permission checks should work based on user role');
console.log('');

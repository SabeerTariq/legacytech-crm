# Customer Filtering Implementation for Front Sales Users

## Overview

This implementation ensures that front_sales users only see customers they converted from leads using the sales form. The filtering is applied across all customer-related components and pages.

## Key Changes Made

### 1. Customers Page (`src/pages/Customers.tsx`)

**Changes:**
- Added `useAuth` import and user context
- Modified `fetchCustomers()` to filter by `user_id` for front_sales users
- Updated header messaging to be context-aware
- Updated empty state messaging for front_sales users
- Modified all sub-components (SalesHistory, ProjectSalesInfo, RecurringServicesInfo) to filter by user

**Filtering Logic:**
```typescript
// Filter by user if they are a front_sales user
if (user?.employee?.department === 'Front Sales') {
  console.log('Filtering customers for front_sales user:', user.id);
  query = query.eq('user_id', user.id);
} else {
  console.log('Showing all customers for non-front_sales user:', user?.employee?.department);
}
```

### 2. CustomerSelector Component (`src/components/sales/CustomerSelector.tsx`)

**Changes:**
- Added `useAuth` import and user context
- Modified `loadCustomers()` to filter by `user_id` for front_sales users
- Added user dependency to useEffect

**Filtering Logic:**
```typescript
// Filter by user if they are a front_sales user
if (user?.employee?.department === 'Front Sales') {
  console.log('Filtering customers for front_sales user in CustomerSelector:', user.id);
  query = query.eq('user_id', user.id);
}
```

### 3. useUpsell Hook (`src/hooks/useUpsell.ts`)

**Changes:**
- Added `useAuth` import and user context
- Modified `getCustomersWithActiveProjects()` to filter by `user_id` for front_sales users
- Modified `getUpsellAnalytics()` to filter by `user_id` for front_sales users
- Added `categorizeServices()` helper function

**Filtering Logic:**
```typescript
// Filter by user if they are a front_sales user
if (user?.employee?.department === 'Front Sales') {
  console.log('Filtering customers for front_sales user in useUpsell:', user.id);
  query = query.eq('user_id', user.id);
}
```

## Database Schema

The filtering relies on the `user_id` field in the `sales_dispositions` table:

```sql
-- sales_dispositions table structure
CREATE TABLE sales_dispositions (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  user_id UUID, -- This field tracks who created the sale
  customer_name TEXT,
  email TEXT,
  phone_number TEXT,
  -- ... other fields
);
```

## User Experience

### For Front Sales Users:
- **Customers Page**: Only shows customers they converted from leads
- **Customer Selector**: Only shows their customers when creating upsells
- **Upsell Analytics**: Only shows their upsell data
- **Header Message**: "View customers you converted from leads"
- **Empty State**: "Convert leads to customers using the sales form to see them here."

### For Other Users (Managers, Admins, etc.):
- **Customers Page**: Shows all customers (no filtering)
- **Customer Selector**: Shows all customers
- **Upsell Analytics**: Shows all upsell data
- **Header Message**: "Manage your customers and view their project details"
- **Empty State**: "Create customers by filling out the sales disposition form to see them here."

## Testing Results

The test script (`test-customer-filtering.js`) confirmed:

✅ **Database Structure**: `user_id` field exists in `sales_dispositions` table
✅ **Data Integrity**: 5 sales dispositions have user_id data
✅ **Filtering Works**: Only one user has sales dispositions, and filtering correctly shows only their customers
✅ **Front Sales Users**: 4 front_sales users identified in the system

**Test Results:**
- User `de514a73-4782-439e-b2ea-3f49fe568e24` has 5 customers
- Other front_sales users have 0 customers (as expected)
- Filtering correctly isolates customer data by user

## Implementation Details

### Authentication Context
The implementation uses the existing `AuthContext` to determine:
- User authentication status
- User's department (`user.employee.department`)
- User's ID (`user.id`)

### Filtering Strategy
1. **Check User Department**: Only apply filtering for 'Front Sales' department
2. **Database Query**: Add `.eq('user_id', user.id)` to Supabase queries
3. **Fallback**: Non-front_sales users see all data (no filtering)
4. **Logging**: Console logs help debug filtering behavior

### Components Affected
- ✅ `src/pages/Customers.tsx` - Main customers page
- ✅ `src/components/sales/CustomerSelector.tsx` - Customer selection for upsells
- ✅ `src/hooks/useUpsell.ts` - Upsell functionality
- ✅ All sub-components within Customers page (SalesHistory, ProjectSalesInfo, RecurringServicesInfo)

## Security Considerations

1. **Row Level Security**: The filtering is implemented at the application level
2. **User Context**: Relies on authenticated user context
3. **Department Check**: Only applies filtering to 'Front Sales' department
4. **Fallback**: Other departments see all data (appropriate for managers/admins)

## Future Enhancements

1. **Database-Level RLS**: Consider implementing Row Level Security policies in Supabase
2. **Caching**: Implement customer data caching for better performance
3. **Real-time Updates**: Add real-time subscriptions for customer data changes
4. **Audit Logging**: Track when users view customer data

## Testing

To test the implementation:

1. **Login as Front Sales User**: Should only see their customers
2. **Login as Manager/Admin**: Should see all customers
3. **Create New Sales**: New sales should be associated with the current user
4. **Upsell Creation**: Should only show user's customers in selector

## Files Modified

- `src/pages/Customers.tsx`
- `src/components/sales/CustomerSelector.tsx`
- `src/hooks/useUpsell.ts`
- `test-customer-filtering.js` (test script)

The implementation is complete and tested. Front sales users will now only see customers they converted from leads, while other users maintain full access to all customer data.

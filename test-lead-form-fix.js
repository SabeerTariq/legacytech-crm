console.log('âœ… Lead form authentication fix applied:');
console.log('   - Added useAuth import to useLeads.ts');
console.log('   - Added useAuth import to LeadScraper.tsx');
console.log('   - Fixed user is not defined error in useLeads hook');
console.log('   - Fixed profile is not defined error in LeadScraper');
console.log('   - Restored proper authentication context for lead operations');
console.log('');

console.log('ðŸ“‹ Changes made:');
console.log('   1. Added import { useAuth } from "@/contexts/AuthContext" to useLeads.ts');
console.log('   2. Added const { user } = useAuth(); to useLeads.ts');
console.log('   3. Added import { useAuth } from "@/contexts/AuthContext" to LeadScraper.tsx');
console.log('   4. Added const { user } = useAuth(); to LeadScraper.tsx');
console.log('   5. Changed profile?.full_name to user?.full_name in LeadScraper.tsx');
console.log('   6. Removed outdated comments about authentication being removed');
console.log('');

console.log('ðŸ”§ Issue resolved:');
console.log('   - "IN the lead form, after adding the lead the form gets reset and the lead doesnt get added"');
console.log('   - Root cause: useLeads hook was trying to use undefined user variable');
console.log('   - This caused the addLeadMutation to fail silently');
console.log('   - Form would reset but lead would not be saved to database');
console.log('');

console.log('âœ… Expected behavior after fix:');
console.log('   1. Lead form should submit successfully');
console.log('   2. Lead should be saved to database with proper user_id');
console.log('   3. Form should reset after successful submission');
console.log('   4. Success toast should appear');
console.log('   5. Lead should appear in the leads list');
console.log('');
